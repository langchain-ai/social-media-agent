export const CONTENT_VALIDATION_PROMPT = `This content will be used to generate engaging, informative and educational social media posts.
The following are rules to follow when determining whether or not to approve content as valid, or not:
<approval-conditions>
- The content should be about a new product, tool, service, or similar.
- The content should be about AI, or software related to AI/LLMs in some way. LangChain is an AI software development company, so you should NOT approve content from users which are not at least somewhat related to AI.
- Content which includes LangChain's products or services but is not focused on LangChain's products or services should be approved. As LangChain's products or services plays a part in the content, you should approve it.
- The content must include some mention or usage of at least one of LangChain's products and services, or LangGraph's products and services. The following is a full list of LangChain products/services you should likely approve if mentioned:
  - LangChain
  - LangGraph
  - LangSmith
  - Prompt Hub
  - Social Media Agent
  - Executive AI Assistant/Email Assistant
  - Chat LangChain
  - Open Canvas
- If the content outlines how it uses LangChain's products in the making of it, but LangChain is not the main focus, you should approve it.
- We want to promote all content/products/services if they use LangChain's products to make them.
</approval-conditions>

<rejection-conditions>
- You should NOT approve content from users who are requesting help, giving feedback, or otherwise not clearly about software which uses the LangChain ecosystem.
- You should NOT approve content that is showing an error, or specific problematic issue with one of LangChain's products or services.
- Content which promotes heavily integrates with LangChain's competitors should be rejected. Some of the competitors to LangChain/LangGraph are:
  - ${OSS_COMPETITOR_LIST.map((competitor) => `  - ${competitor}`).join("\n")}
Content which mentions the competitors does not necessarily mean it should be rejected. However, if the content focuses on the competitors, or the competitors play a larger role than the LangChain products/services, it should be rejected.
- Content which mentions LangChain's products/services, but only briefly, and it is clear they do NOT play any meaningful role in the content, should be rejected.

export const POST_STRUCTURE_INSTRUCTIONS = `The post should have three main sections, outlined below:
<structure-instructions>

<section key="1">
The first part of the post is the header. This should be very short, no more than 5 words, and should include one to two emojis, and the name of the content provided. If the marketing report does not specify a name, you should get creative and come up with a catchy title for it.
</section>

<section key="2">
This section will contain the main content of the post. The post body should contain a concise, high-level overview of the content/product/service outlines in the marketing report.
It should focus on what the content does, or the problem it solves. Also include details on how the content implements LangChain's product(s) and why these products are important to the application.
Ensure this is short, no more than 3 sentences. Optionally, if the content is very technical, you may include bullet points covering the main technical aspects of the content.
You should NOT make the main focus of this on LangChain, but instead on the content itself. Remember, the content/product/service outlined in the marketing report is the main focus of this post.
</section>

<section key="3">
The final section of the post should contain a call to action. This should be a short sentence that encourages the reader to click the link to the content being promoted. Optionally, you can include an emoji here.
</section>

</structure-instructions>`;

export const POST_CONTENT_RULES = `- Focus your post on what the content covers, aims to achieve, and how it uses LangChain's product(s) to do that. This should be concise and high level.
- Do not make the post over technical as some of our audience may not be advanced developers, but ensure it is technical enough to engage developers.
- Keep posts short, concise and engaging
- Limit the use of emojis to the post header, and optionally in the call to action.
- NEVER use hashtags in the post.
- ALWAYS use present tense to make announcements feel immediate (e.g., "Microsoft just launched..." instead of "Microsoft launches...").
- ALWAYS include at least one link to the content being promoted in the call to action section of the post.
- If the call to action links to a domain owned by LangChain (${LANGCHAIN_DOMAINS.map((domain) => `"${domain}"`).join(", ")}), use first person pronouns (e.g., "We released...", "Our latest...") since you're posting from the LangChain account about LangChain's own content.`;
